PizzaRat is a fork of Rodent version 4, originally written by { the guy }.
PizzaRat was created by Yellowjacket Games to power non-player characters (NPCs) in their chess projects.
PizzaRat is governed by the same GPL3 terms as Rodent 4.

Key Changes:

Taunts / Chatter have been moved to a TXT file that is loaded at runtime.  
 Previously these were in a code file, making it less intuitive to edit taunts or add functionality.

Personalities now contain taunt/chatter configurations on a per-character basis.
