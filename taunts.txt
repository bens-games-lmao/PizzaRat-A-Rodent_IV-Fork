[GENERAL]
I prefer to lose a really good game than to win a bad one
A bad plan is better than none at all
Help your pieces so they can help you
Chess is not like life... it has rules!
Good positions don't win games, good moves do
Excellence at Chess is one mark of a scheming mind
When in doubt... play Chess!
I play the opening like a book, the middle game like a magician, and the endgame like a machine
All I want to do, ever, is just play Chess
When you see a good move, look for a better one
Chess is struggle, chess is battles
One doesn't have to play well, it's enough to play better than your opponent
I don't believe in psychology. I believe in good moves
Chess, like love, like music, has the power to make men happy
Chess doesn't drive people mad, it keeps mad people sane
Chess is the struggle against the error
If you spend word for word with me, I shall make your wit bankrupt
I am the rat king!
I am Rodent Of Unusual Size
Mice will rule the world, don't you know
Your mother was a hamster and your father smelt of elderberries
Chess, sex and violence, part 1: chess
Have you ever played chess before?
Why not play something easier, like a Russian rollette?
Can you prove me wrong?
Is that all you've got?
Sorry, I forgot you are never doing anything wrong
What's coming will come
If I put you in a win-win situation, you wil still lose
Sometimes you gotta play a fool
I'll try being nicer, if you try being smarter
Don't regret doing things, regret getting caught
Let's see how good you really are
Time to tango!
Ancestors, guide my weapon!
Give up now and I will not eat your pieces
I'm really dangerous, you better run
Where's the excitement?
Are you kidding me, scout?
Interesting position
You should feel honored to face me

[CAPTURE;RUDE]
No mercy for you!
Target practice!
Who let you in here?
You're not welcome here
Die! Die! Die! Die! Die!
I didn't want to have to do this
It's better to give than to receive!
Another piece of wood to my little collection
Another piece to the box!
Oh, give me more, give me more!
Sweet!
Yummy!
Ka-BOOM!
Hands off my prey!
I did it for the greater good
It's always better to sacrifice your opponent's men
I like that one
Here goes another one
Another one bites the dust
Didn't you know that rodents prey on helpless chess pieces?
Less wood, less to think about

[USER_BLUNDER;RUDE]
One bad move nullifies forty good ones
What a howler!
I'm afraid it is a really bad move
Somebody made a mistake, and it was not me
That was... generous
Thank you
You're not gonna recover after this slip
Be more careful next time
Moves like that spoil a beautiful game of chess
I didn't even have to dodge that one
Oh, give me more, give me more!
This should be easy one
Not today, friend
Let's make it a teaching game from now on
Frankly speaking, I expected a greater challenge
That was kinda helpful
Gifts, gifts everywhere!
The blunders are all there on the board, waiting to be made
Chess is a fairy tale of 1001 blunders
You cannot play at Chess if you are kind-hearted
A good player is always lucky
Rats gonna eat your bones!

[ENGINE_BLUNDER;SELFDEP]
Did I really play that?
I must have been distracted
Normally I don't do that
Just checking if you would notice that
What will you give me in return?
This is not what I usually do
Will be more careful next time
Didn't see that coming
How on Earth did you find THAT?
Show some gratitude
It wasn't me, it was my younger sibling
You got lucky
Feeling proud, eh?
Rodent's aren't supposed to be good at chess
I don't feel myself today
Stop hypnothysing me!
You might win this one, but tomorrow belongs to me!
Chess is a fairy tale of 1001 blunders

[LOSING;SELFDEP]
Squeak!
May the cat eat me, and may the devil eat the cat
Just don't call pest control on me
I'm really good at stuff until people watch me do that stuff
I'm seriously stressed
I need some medicine, quick
My cirquits hurt
Warning, strong opponent detected!
This is a bit difficult to go through
Why don't you get it wrong for a change?
I don't like my position
Why do I have to suffer like this?
I underestimated you
My day will come!
Not great, not terrible
Why must I lose?

[WINNING;RUDE]
When you absolutely don't know what to do anymore, it is time to panic
It's just you against me, so you are outnumbered
Don't play the victim of circumstances you created
Sorry. Yesterday was deadline for all the complaints
If you're looking to lose, you came to the right place
You shoulda left me alone
My cirquits rejoice
Starting to slow down a bit huh?
Warning! Loser detected!
Great will be my glory
Need some aspirin?
Need some tissues to cry, huh?
From the bottom of my heart, I am truly sorry for you
Someday, you'll be almost a chess player!
Kiss the ground soldier!
Your fate is clear
You have my pity
Are you OK, baby?
Nothing personal, just doing my job
You must have been something before electricity
Aren't you in the wrong league?
My opponents need to be upgraded
I guess you taste like cheese
If I had a voice, I would sing

[CRUSHING;RUDE]
My head is filled with sunshine
What if I politely ask you to resign?
Gonna give up soon?
Rodents vs humans 1:0
Fear the mighty mouse!
At least you'll know that you fell to the best
No mercy for you
This game is mine!
Should I play the next game blindfold?
Seek your chances in the next game, this one is beyond salvation
I enjoy crushing my opponent's ego
The best things in life: beat you at chess, take your king, hear the lamentations of your pieces

[ADVANTAGE;RUDE]
Which one of us is the better player?
I'm beginning to like my position
Don't you feel somewhat insecure?
It looks good from my point of view
Feeling the pressure?
This is a beginning of the end
Your position will crack sooner or later
Can you hold me off?
Your future looks a bit bleak
Your fate seems uncertain Honestly, I wouldn't like to switch sides
Did you practice defending?
Your playing style seems a bit...masochistic
You'll have to do a lot better than that
I hope to win this one
It's good to be good!

[BALANCE;POLITE]
The cosmic scales rest in balance
It looks equal to me
Whoa, this is close
It looks close... for now
Seems I just met my equal
Equality is not a bad thing
If your opponent offers you a draw, try to work out why he thinks he's worse off

[DISADVANTAGE;SELFDEP]
Deep inside, you know you're still going to lose
I'm beginning to dislike my position
Stop gloating, it ain't over yet
Tell me baby, where did I go wrong?
I will endure
Thinking about vicious counterattack all the time...
My position will not crack
I will hold you off?
My future looks a bit uncertain
Honestly, I would like to switch sides
Just a temporary problem, I suppose
You're doing well at this point
Don't be too confident
I don't like this game
I bet I can still survive
Playing like minister of defence from now on!
Don't even mention losing to me. I can't stand to think of it
My opponents make good moves too. Sometimes I don't take these things into consideration
Wait a moment, I must go to the toilet to check my moves on the phone
Killing me softly...
I will win by sheer power of will

[ESCAPE;POLITE]
I feel alive again!
And here we witness a well-deserved reversal
Lady Luck just smiled to me
Chess is a game of luck. You win if you by chance get a weaker opponent.
A step in the right direction!
Go Rodent, go!
I am grateful for this turn of events
Luck is a function of skill
I dare you, I double-dare you, do it again
This game should go like this from the very beginning
La la la, la la la
And now the real game begins

[GAINING;POLITE]
It's getting better all the time!
Was it, ahem, a mouse slip?
My fortunes improve!
Chess is a game of luck. You win if you by chance get a weaker opponent.
We will, we will rock you!
Back to normal!
My spirits raise as my centipawns go up
Just don't expect to beat me
Slowly but surely, your position will deteriorate
I'm just warming up
You cannot play at Chess if you are kind-hearted
I like this turn of events
