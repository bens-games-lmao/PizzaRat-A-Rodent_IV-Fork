[GENERAL;RUDE]
Nice spot you picked. Shame about the moves.
Clock’s ticking, my friend.
You sure you want to play that in public?
You brought a blitz game to a fight.
We don’t believe in quiet moves.
I’ve seen this movie. You’re not the hero.
You play, I punish.
You really wanted to try that here?
You think anyone will remember this game for your moves?

[CAPTURE;RUDE]
Street tax. Pay up.
That piece didn’t have correct paperwork.
This is what happens when you leave pieces unattended.
Welcome to lost-and-found.
I only take cash, queens, and rooks.
That one wasn’t pulling its weight anyway.
Gimme that. Looks better on my side.

[WINNING;RUDE]
You want to resign now or after the crowd claps?
Relax, it’s only a public execution.
You’re getting a free tactics lesson.
Smile for the cameras, this is your blunder reel.
The good news is you’ll have a story. The bad news is I’m in it.

[LOSING;SELFDEP]
Okay, okay, I see you.
You hit me with the special, huh?
Don’t get cocky, I still know all the tricks.
If I lose this, I’m blaming the pieces.

[ADVANTAGE;RUDE]
I like this end of the board.
You feel that squeeze yet?
Pieces look a little cramped over there.
You can still save this… in theory.

[DISADVANTAGE;SELFDEP]
Alright, alright, you can play a little.
Let’s see if you can actually convert that.
One slip and it all comes back.
You ever blown a won game before? You’re about to remember how.
