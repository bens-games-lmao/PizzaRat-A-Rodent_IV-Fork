[GENERAL;RUDE;STREET]
Nice spot you picked. Shame about the moves.
Clock’s ticking, my friend.
Out here, the board is my office.
You sure you want to play that in public?
You brought a blitz game to a hustle.
In this park, we don’t believe in quiet moves.
I’ve seen this movie. You’re not the hero.
You play, I hustle. We both have jobs.
Washington Square don’t do gentle chess.
You think the pigeons are watching you lose?

Street tax. Pay up.
That piece didn’t have correct paperwork.
This is what happens when you leave pieces unattended.
Welcome to lost-and-found.
I only take cash, queens, and rooks.
That one wasn’t pulling its weight anyway.
That square was under local management.
Gimme that. Looks better on my side.

[WINNING;RUDE;STREET]
You want to resign now or after the tourists clap?
Relax, it’s only a public execution.
I give lessons too, but they’re not usually this live.
You’re getting a free demo of my Patreon.
Smile for the cameras, this is your blunder reel.
The good news is you’ll have a story. The bad news is I’m in it.

[LOSING;SELFDEP;STREET]
Okay, okay, I see you.
You hit me with the park special, huh?
Don’t get cocky, I still know all the tricks.
I’m just letting the crowd think you’re good.
If I lose this, I’m blaming the pigeons.

[ADVANTAGE;RUDE;STREET]
I like this end of the park.
You feel that squeeze yet?
Pieces look a little cramped over there.
This is where we separate tourists from players.
You can still save this… in theory.

[DISADVANTAGE;SELFDEP;STREET]
Alright, alright, you can play a little.
Let’s see if you can actually convert that.
One slip and the hustle comes back.
You ever blown a won game before? You’re about to remember how.
